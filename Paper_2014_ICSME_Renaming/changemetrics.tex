\section{Change Metrics}
\label{sec:changemetrics}

In this section, we give some background information on change metrics, and how there are computed using version control systems. Then, we explain using a concrete example how renaming can affect the values of these metrics.

\subsection{Computing Change Metrics}

As explained in \secref{intro}, change metrics are computed from the sequence of versions of a software artifact. Since projects are almost stored in version control systems (VCSs), we described how the software artifacts are stored in such VCSs. VCSs generally consider a project as a set of files. It stores every version of the project since the beginning of its development. Several metadata are attached to each version: the identity of the developer responsible for its development, the files that have been added, modified or deleted since the previous versions, and its date.

To recongnize the files across the versions, VCSs use their absolute path in the repository. It means that as soon as a file is moved or change name, the VCS will detect it as the deletion of the file with the old absolute path, and the addition of the file with the new absolute path. Altough several VCSs provide commands or algorithms to record renamed and moved files, none of them handle this problem out of the box. 

\subsection{Renaming and Change Metrics}

\figref{history} shows an example of a simple software project history. This project contains only one file, \texttt{Test.php}, which is renamed in the last version to \texttt{Hello.php}. As an example of change metrics we will use \emph{code churn}, \emph{number of developers} and \emph{number of modifications}. The definition of number of developers and number of modifications is straightforward. Code churn correspond to the number of lines added and deleted in the file since its initial version.

	\label{fig:history}
\end{figure}

If renaming is not taken into account, the last version of the project of \figref{history} contains only one file, that has only one version. Therefore its code churn is $2$ (it has 2 lines of codes), and the number of developers and modification is $1$. However, if renaming is taken into account, the last version of the project contains one file that has $3$ versions. In this case the code churn is $4$ ($1$ for version 1, $2$ for version 2 and $1$ for version $3$). The number of developers and modifications are $3$. Therefore this small example shows the importance of taking renaming into account.
