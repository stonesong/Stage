Software change metrics, such as \emph{code churn} or \emph{number of developers}, has been shown good indicators for software quality in several studies. However, as these metrics are computed from the modifications performed to a software artifact, their values may be skewed in case of artifact renaming, which can thus be a important threat to validity of studies using such metrics. We therefore assess its impact in this article. To that extent, we perform an empirical study on five open-source popular and mature software projects with the intent to evaluate the amount of renaming and its effect on change metrics. We observed that renaming can significantly alter the metrics in some projects. We also noticed that this effect can be minimized by following some simple guidelines presented in this paper.
