Software change metrics (also called process metrics), such as code churn or number of developers, were shown good indicators for defect prediction in several studies. However, as these metrics are computed from the changes performed on a software artifact, their values may be skewed in case of artifact renaming, which is known to confuse version control systems and can thus be a important threat to validity of studies using such metrics. In this article, we assess the impact on artifact renaming on change metrics. To that extent, we perform an empirical study on five open-source popular and mature software projects with the intent give some insight about the amount of renaming, and its effect on change metrics values. We observed that artifact renaming can significantly skew the values of change metrics in some projects. Finally we evaluate past studies with regard to this threat and provide guidelines for future studies.
