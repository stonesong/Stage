Software change metrics, such as \emph{code churn} or \emph{number of developers}, are good indicators for software quality, as it has been observed in several studies. However, as these metrics are computed from the changes performed to a software artifact, their value may be skewed in case of artifact renaming, which can therefore be a important threat to validity. This issue is underestimated in most of the existing software study. We therefore propose to assess its impact in this paper. To that extent, we have performed an empirical study on five open-source programs with the intent to evaluate the amount of renaming and their effect on change metrics. We observed that renaming can significantly alter the metrics for some projects. We also noticed that this effect can be minimizing by following some simple guidelines presented in this paper.
