\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this article, we assessed the impact of artifact renaming on the values of software change metrics. We conducted an empirical study on five popular and mature open-source software projects. We observed that initial periods of projects are more prone to renaming than the other periods. More importantly, we observed that other periods can contain a significant amount of renaming, especially those corresponding to the development of major releases. Finally, we observed that renaming can significantly skew the values of change metrics. Therefore, researchers and practitioners should be very careful when computing change metrics. We recommend to avoid computing change metrics on initial periods. Finally, we highly recommend to systematically use a renaming detection algorithm when computing change metrics on other periods as it can change significantly the values of change metrics.

As a future work, we plan to evaluate the accuracy of existing renaming detection algorithms. We also plan to evaluate the impact of code merging on software change metrics.
